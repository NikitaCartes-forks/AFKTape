This mod was made to simulate taping down buttons while AFK. This can be very useful when using any farm that require holding buttons down, 
or making tedious tasks like walking/boating long distances simple.

All you need to do is hold down any button or key and press the tape button (`K` by default) to keep them held down.

Once held down, it will ungrab your cursor so you can do other things on your computer! Hold `LeftAlt` to temporaily regrab your cursor if you need to reposition your character.

Held buttons will also pause when you open a gui, and then continue after, so it doesn't allow for anything that couldn't be done in vanilla, avoiding accidental triggering of anti-cheat detections.
